.I device
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBReiserfsck\fR searches for a Reiserfs filesystem on a device, replays 
any necessary transactions, and either checks or repairs the file system.
.TP
.I device
is the special file corresponding to the device or partition (e.g /dev/hdXX 
for IDE disk partition or /dev/sdXX for SCSI disk partition).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --check
This default action checks file system consistency and reports but 
does not repair any corruption that it finds. This option may be 
used on a read-only file system mount.  The \fB--check\fR option exits 
with status 0 to indicate that no corruption was found.  Otherwise,
\fBreiserfsck\fR returns 1 to indicate corruption that can be fixed with 
\fB--fix-fixable\fR and 2 to indicate corruption that requires 
\fB--rebuild-tree\fR.
.TP
.B --fix-fixable
This option recovers certain kinds of corruption that do not require 
rebuilding the entire file system tree (\fB--rebuild-tree\fR). Normally 
you only need this option if the \fB--check\fR option reports 
"corruption that can be fixed with \fB--fix-fixable\fR". This includes: 
zeroing invalid data-block pointers, correcting st_size and st_blocks 
for directories, and deleting invalid directory entries.
.TP
.B --rebuild-sb
This option recovers the superblock on a Reiserfs partition.  Normally you 
only need this option if mount reports "read_super_block: can't find 
a reiserfs file system" and you are sure that a Reiserfs file system is 
there.
.TP
.B --rebuild-tree
This option rebuilds the entire file system tree using leaf nodes found 
on the device.  Normally you only need this option if the \fB--check\fR 
option reports "corruption that can be fixed only during \fB--rebuild-tree\fR". 
You are strongly encouraged to make a backup copy of the whole partition 
before attempting the \fB--rebuild-tree\fR option.
.TP
.B --clean-attributes
This option cleans reserved fields of Stat-Data items.
.TP
.B \fB--journal-device \fIdevice \fR, \fB-j \fIdevice \fR
This option supplies the device name of the current file system journal.  
This option is required when the journal resides on a separate device 
from the main data device (although it can be avoided with the expert
option \fB--no-journal-available\fR).
.TP 
.\" .B --interactive, -i
.\" This makes \fBreiserfsck\fR to stop after each pass completed.
.\" .TP
.B --adjust-file-size, -z
This option causes \fBreiserfsck\fR to correct file sizes that
are larger than the offset of the last discovered byte.  This
implies that holes at the end of a file will be removed.  File
sizes that are smaller than the offset of the last discovered
byte are corrected by --fix-fixable.
.TP
\fB--logfile \fIfilename\fR, \fB-l \fI filename\fR
This option causes \fBreiserfsck\fR to report any corruption it finds 
to the specified log file rather than stderr.
.TP
.B --nolog, -n
This option prevents \fBreiserfsck\fR from reporting any kinds of corruption.
.TP
.B --quiet, -q
This option prevents \fBreiserfsck\fR from reporting its rate of progress.
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB-p\fR
These options are usually passed by fsck -A during the automatic 
checking of /etc/fstab partitions.  For compatibility, these options
simply cause reiserfsck to print information about the specified file 
system.  No checks are performed. 
When it is set - \fBreiserfsck\fR assumes that it is called by \fBfsck\fR -A,
provides some information about the specified filesystem and exits. 
.TP
.B -V
This option prints the reiserfsprogs version and exit.
.TP
\fB-r\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-y\fR
These options are ignored.
.TP
.B -V\fR, \fB-f\fR
prints version and exits
.SH EXPERT OPTIONS
DO NOT USE THESE OPTIONS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU LOSE DATA AS A RESULT OF THESE
OPTIONS.
.TP
.B \fB\--no-journal-available\fR
This option allows \fBreiserfsck\fR to proceed when the journal device is 
not available. This option has no effect when the journal is located on 
the main data device. NOTE: after this operation you must use \fBreiserfstune\fR 
to specify a new journal device.
.TP
.B --scan-whole-partition, -S
This option causes \fB--rebuild-tree\fR to scan the whole partition, not only 
used space on the partition.
.SH EXAMPLE OF USING
1. You think something may be wrong with a reiserfs partition on /dev/hda1 
or you would just like to perform a periodic disk check.

2. Run \fBreiserfsck --check --logfile check.log /dev/hda1\fR. If \fBreiserfsck 
--check\fR exits with status 0 it means no errors were discovered. 

3. If \fBreiserfsck --check\fR exits with status 1 (and reports about fixable 
corruptions) it means that you should run \fBreiserfsck --fix-fixable --logfile 
fixable.log /dev/hda1\fR.

4. If \fBreiserfsck --check\fR exits with status 2 (and reports about fatal 
corruptions) it means that you need to run \fBreiserfsck --rebuild-tree\fR.  
If \fBreiserfsck --check\fR fails in some way you should also run \fBreiserfsck 
--rebuild-tree\fR, but we also encourage you to submit this as a bug report.

5. Before running \fBreiserfsck --rebuild-tree\fR, please make a backup of 
the whole partition before proceeding. Then run \fBreiserfsck --rebuild-tree 
--logfile rebuild.log /dev/hda1\fR.

6. If the \fB--rebuild-tree\fR step fails or does not recover what you expected, 
please submit this as a bug report. Try to provide as much information as 
possible and we will try to help solve the problem.
